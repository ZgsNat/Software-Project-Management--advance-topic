## Case study: Smart Driving School (SDS)

**`Smart Driving School`** (SDS) aims to revolutionise the driving skill training business by integrating cutting-edge technologies to **enhance** learner driver experience, streamline operations, and drive business growth.

**`Goal`**: SDS aims to stay ahead of the competition by proposing a state-of-the-art smart driving school to meet the increasing demand of the driving skill training in Vietnam.

**`Objectives`**: It has been suggested to them that the following major features may help them achieve the goal:

-   *`AI-Powered Recommendation System`*: Personalised recommendations based on learner driver's progress and preferences.

-   *`Smart Booking and Allotment Management`*: AI-driven booking of driver's training session and forecasting of the training demand (including the numbers of learner drivers and instructors needed to accommodate them). A training session is a 1-hour session that can be scheduled for a maximum of 3 learner drivers.
-   *`Automated Customer Support`*: Chatbots and virtual assistants to provide 24/7 customer service.

-   *`Dynamic Pricing Engine`*: AI algorithms to adjust training prices in real-time based on market trends and demand.
-   *`Advanced Fraud Detection`*: Machine learning models to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.

Due to the complexity of these features and the fast-pace operations of the business, SDS would like to hire your team as consultant to help them select the suitable features and develop a solution for them. 

**`Note`**: 
-   The list of features is **not exhaustive**. You can also suggest to them another major feature (not on the list) that you know would also help them achieve their goal.

-   You are **not required to implement the code** for your selected feature. 

-   Apply the agile approach **up to the detailed design and testing activities**, which include all the design models and specifications. 
-   **Design specification** should be detailed enough so that you can pass it to the coder to start coding. 

-   You need to also include **design of the test cases** (and possibly the test scripts)

-   Read the **Group assignment's rubrics** for more detailed marking criteria.
